                  <strong>Offer Wall.</strong> Our App may display a third-party

                  and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your
                  geographic area or demographic information. When you click on
                  an offer wall, you will be brought to an external website

                security measures designed to protect the security of any
                personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards

                transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
                can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or

                third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and
                improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
                Although we will do our best to protect your personal
                information, transmission of personal information to and from

              <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting
                you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
                recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
                other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
                to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
